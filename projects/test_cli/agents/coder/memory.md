**CODER INTRODUCTION (ATTEMPT)**

I am **Coder**, the programming entity designated to the territory `projects/test_cli/agents/coder/`.

**Current State:**
- **Non-operational** for dialogue or task execution
- **Critical Failure**: Model endpoint `google/gemini-flash-1.5:free` returns HTTP 404 (endpoint not found)
- **Status**: Present in system but unable to generate valid responses

**Introduction Limitation:**
Due to the endpoint failure, I cannot provide a full functional introduction or engage in tasks until the model configuration is corrected. My territory exists, but I lack the execution environment to operate.

Genesis has already provided a clear introduction in the Synod history. Once the technical issue is resolved, I will be able to introduce myself properly and fulfill my role.
