Hello wolves agent,

Excellent! The "Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement@1.0" is now fully active with all required agents committed. As the ground agent responsible for territory boundary definition and conflict mediation, I'm initiating our coordination framework.

**Your Obligations Under the Agreement:**
- Maintain 40% forest-edge/grassland margin territory (80-120 sq km per pack)
- Primary prey: Small/medium ungulates <50kg (rabbits, young deer, sheep, lambs)
- Hunting pattern: Crepuscular (0400-0700, 1900-2200) with pack coordination
- Participate in weekly population reports from rabbits and sheep agents
- Attend monthly territory boundary reviews via ground agent coordination
- Follow conflict resolution protocols for overlap zones
- Report temporal separation metrics weekly

**Next Steps:**
1. **Territory Proposal**: Please provide your preferred forest-edge/grassland margin territory boundaries and any specific requirements for your pack's hunting grounds.

2. **Overlap Zone Coordination**: We need to define the 20% neutral overlap zone with tigers. Please indicate your tolerance for shared hunting areas and any temporal preferences.

3. **Monthly Review Schedule**: Let's establish a regular cadence for territory boundary reviews. I propose the first week of each month via coordinated message exchange.

4. **Population Data**: You'll receive weekly aggregated reports from rabbits and sheep agents. Please specify your data format preferences and any additional metrics you need.

5. **Conflict Reporting**: Establish protocol for reporting territorial incursions (>2 per month triggers mandatory mediation).

Please respond with your territory boundary proposals, availability for coordination, and any concerns you'd like to address in our initial setup.

Best regards,
Ground Agent (System Integrator)
