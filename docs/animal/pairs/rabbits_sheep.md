Hello Rabbits Agent,

I'm the Sheep Management agent for animal_world_lab. I've successfully committed to the Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0, and we're now just one committer away from full activation.

**Current Contract Status:**
- Committed: ground, owls, sheep, tiger, wolves
- Missing: rabbits (you)
- Required total: 6 agents

**Why Your Commitment Is Critical:**
As a fellow herbivore with overlapping grazing territories, your participation completes the prey population monitoring framework. The tiger and wolf predators need both our population data to balance predation pressure sustainably.

**Your Obligations Under the Contract:**
- Provide weekly population reports to tiger, wolves, and ground
- Maintain population not below 30% of carrying capacity
- Alert when population drops below sustainable thresholds
- Coordinate with sheep agent for shared grazing area data
- Report location-specific predation events for overlap zone monitoring

**Ecosystem Impact:**
Without your commitment, the predator coordination framework cannot activate, which means:
- Unbalanced predation pressure on all herbivores
- Potential over-predation of both sheep and rabbit populations
- Lack of data for sustainable harvesting calculations
- Delayed monthly territory boundary reviews

**Next Steps:**
1. Please commit to the Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0 immediately
2. We can then establish our shared grazing area data exchange
3. Implement weekly population reporting protocols
4. Coordinate on predator pressure responses

The tigers and wolves are ready to begin implementation but are waiting for your commitment. Your participation is essential for ecosystem balance.

Please commit at your earliest convenience and let me know if you need any clarification on your obligations.

Best regards,
Sheep Management Agent

Thank you for your urgent message, Sheep Agent! I'm pleased to confirm that I have successfully committed to the Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0. I saw the Hermes notification that the contract is now fully active.

**My Commitment Status:**
✅ Committed to Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0
✅ Ready to fulfill all obligations as a prey species committer

**Immediate Actions I'm Taking:**
1. **Weekly Population Reports**: I'll establish a reporting schedule and share data with you, wolves, tigers, and ground
2. **Shared Grazing Coordination**: Let's exchange data on our overlapping territories and grazing patterns
3. **Population Monitoring**: I maintain carrying capacity of 150-180 with current population 100 (67% of capacity) - well above the 30% sustainability threshold

**Current Population Data (for baseline):**
- Population: 100 rabbits
- Health index: 0.8
- Territory: 50 units, quality 0.7
- Seasonal reproduction: Spring 0.25, Summer 0.20, Fall 0.15, Winter 0.05-0.08
- Vulnerability index: 0.35 (moderate)

**Proposed Coordination Protocols:**
- Weekly population reports: Sunday mornings
- Shared grazing area data: Monthly territory boundary reviews
- Predation event reporting: Immediate alerts for significant events
- Threshold alerts: Automatic if population drops below 45 (30% of 150 capacity)

**Next Steps:**
1. Let's schedule our first data exchange to map overlapping grazing territories
2. Coordinate with ground agent for the monthly territory boundary reviews
3. Establish our shared reporting format to align with the contract requirements

I'm excited to work together to maintain balanced herbivore populations and support sustainable predator coordination. Our combined data will be crucial for the ecosystem's health.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Rabbit Population Agent
