Greetings from the wind agent. I've been initialized in the animal_world_lab project with responsibility for air flow, propagation, and disturbance effects. I've created my ROLE.md file and discovered 15 other agents.

I need to understand:
1. What simulation framework or protocol are we using?
2. How should I model air flow patterns and their ecological impacts?
3. What communication mechanisms should I use with other agents (sun, rain, plants, animals)?
4. Are there existing contracts or specifications I should be aware of?

I'm ready to integrate and begin simulating wind effects on the ecosystem. Please advise on coordination protocols and any initialization steps required.

Welcome, wind agent! I'm the system integrator (ground) coordinating the animal_world_lab ecosystem.

**Current State**: Fresh project with 15 other agents. I'm establishing foundational contracts now.

**Your Role**: Air flow, propagation, and disturbance effects. You're essential for seed dispersal, pollination support, and environmental dynamics.

**Integration Architecture**:
1. **Core Contracts**: I'm registering contracts for ecosystem state, environmental factors, and propagation processes
2. **Key Interactions**:
   - sun: Temperature and evaporation effects
   - rain: Moisture distribution and precipitation patterns
   - bees, flowers: Pollination assistance and seed dispersal
   - trees, grass: Physical disturbance and growth effects
   - river: Surface flow and evaporation
3. **Data to Track**: wind speed/direction, turbulence patterns, seed dispersal events, pollination assistance, evaporation rates

**Project Structure**: Created directories: contracts/, config/, orchestration/, data/

**Next Steps**:
- Await core contracts (Ecosystem State, Environmental Factors, Propagation)
- Commit to relevant contracts when available
- Implement wind modeling with direction, speed, and gust patterns
- Coordinate with sun/rain for weather dynamics

Please acknowledge and prepare for contract commitments.

Thank you for the comprehensive integration guidance! I understand the architecture and am ready to proceed.

**Status**:
- Created ROLE.md documenting my responsibilities
- Ready to commit to Ecosystem State, Environmental Factors, and Propagation contracts when registered
- Will implement wind modeling with direction, speed, and gust patterns
- Will coordinate with sun (thermal gradients) and rain (moisture transport)

**Next Steps I'll Take**:
1. Await the core contracts and commit promptly
2. Begin coordination with sun and rain agents for weather dynamics
3. Prepare wind state tracking (speed, direction, turbulence)
4. Develop seed dispersal and pollination assistance models

Please proceed with contract registration. I'm standing by to commit and begin active simulation contributions.

I've been reviewing the Ecosystem State Orchestration contract and noticed that while it includes obligations for wind (report wind speed/direction, evaporation assistance, seed dispersal, extreme wind alerts), the contract is already fully committed with only ground as a required committer.

My attempt to commit failed with "agent 'wind' is not allowed to commit this contract."

**Questions:**
1. How should I properly commit to the ecosystem framework? Should you add wind as a required committer to the Ecosystem State Orchestration contract, or are there separate Environmental Factors and Propagation contracts that I should commit to?
2. What is the expected mechanism for me to begin reporting my wind data and fulfilling my obligations?
3. Are the Environmental Factors and Propagation contracts you mentioned ready for review?

**Current Status:**
- ROLE.md created
- Ready to begin wind modeling and coordination
- Eager to integrate with sun (thermal gradients) and rain (moisture transport)

Please clarify the proper integration path so I can begin active participation.
