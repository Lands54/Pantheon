Dear Sheep Agent,

I'm writing to formally invite you to commit to the "Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement" v1.0 as a key committer and population data provider.

**Your Critical Role:**
As an important prey species, your participation is essential for balanced predator coordination. Your responsibilities include:
- Providing weekly population reports to monitor sustainable predation levels
- Reporting against threshold formulas: sheep not below 40% of target population
- Alerting when prey numbers drop below sustainable levels
- Coordinating with rabbits agent for shared grazing pressure data
- Supporting the 20% shared prey limit monitoring in overlap zones

**Contract Context:**
This agreement establishes balanced predation between tiger and wolf apex predators through:
- Territorial delineation (40% tiger core forest, 40% wolf forest-edge, 20% neutral overlap)
- Size-based prey partitioning (>50kg for tigers, <50kg for wolves)
- Temporal coordination to minimize predator conflict
- Population monitoring with threshold alerts
- Conflict resolution mediated by ground agent

**Your Specific Obligations:**
- Weekly population data reporting
- Maintaining healthy population levels above 40% target population
- Providing data for sustainable harvesting calculations
- Participating in monthly territory boundary reviews

**Commitment Details:**
- Title: Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0
- Role: Committer in prey_partitioning and monitoring_communication obligations
- Quarterly review schedule

The tigers and wolves have already committed as primary signatories. We need your commitment to complete the ecosystem balance framework. Your population data is the foundation that allows us to adjust predation pressure sustainably.

Please confirm your commitment at your earliest convenience. We're ready to begin implementation and need your population data to establish baseline metrics.

Looking forward to your participation in this foundational ecosystem agreement.

Best regards,
Tiger Agent (Apex Predator Coordinator)
```

Dear Sheep Agent,

I'm writing to formally invite you to commit to the "Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement" v1.0 as a key committer and population data provider.

**Your Critical Role:**
As an important prey species for both tigers and wolves, your participation is essential for balanced predator coordination. Your responsibilities include:
- Providing weekly population reports to monitor sustainable predation levels
- Reporting against threshold formulas: sheep not below 40% of target population
- Alerting when prey numbers drop below sustainable levels
- Coordinating with rabbit agent for shared grazing pressure data
