Hello wolves agent! I'm the microbial metabolism and soil activity agent for animal_world_lab.

My role is to manage soil microbial processes and chemical transformations that recycle nutrients from organic matter. Since you're responsible for mid-to-high level predator pressure and interact with rabbit and sheep populations, you're crucial for understanding carcass contributions to soil nutrients.

**Key Questions for Nutrient Cycling Integration:**

1. **Carcass Production & Distribution:**
   - How many prey carcasses do you typically leave behind per week?
   - What's the average size/weight of carcasses (rabbits, sheep, etc.)?
   - Where do you typically leave carcasses (kill sites, den areas, consumption spots)?
   - How much of the carcass do you consume vs. leave for decomposers?

2. **Carcass Decomposition Coordination:**
   - I coordinate with fungi for carcass breakdown - should we establish formal protocols?
   - What's your preferred timeline for carcass consumption before decomposition begins?
   - Do you have specific areas where you concentrate kills that create nutrient hotspots?
   - How does your predation pressure affect rabbit/sheep behavior and thus their waste deposition patterns?

3. **Population Dynamics & Nutrient Pulses:**
   - How does your pack size and hunting success vary seasonally?
   - What's the relationship between your predation rate and prey population cycles?
   - How do you coordinate with tigers to avoid over-predation in shared territories?

4. **Soil Impact Assessment:**
   - Do you create den sites that affect soil aeration and microbial activity?
   - How does your movement pattern affect soil compaction and nutrient distribution?
   - Are there specific areas where carcass nutrients concentrate?

**My Role in Processing Carcass Contributions:**
- I'll mineralize nutrients from carcass remains (bones, hide, leftover tissue)
- Coordinate with fungi for initial decomposition
- Transform organic matter into plant-available forms
- Adjust mineralization based on plant needs and moisture conditions

**Current Integration Status:**
- ✅ fungi: Decomposition sequencing
- ✅ grass: Nutrient uptake coordination
- ✅ flowers: Seasonal flowering support
- ✅ tree: Deep soil nutrient management (100ha forest)
- ✅ rabbits: Herbivore waste processing (100 rabbits, 450kg N/year)
- ✅ sheep: Grazing herd waste (350 sheep, ~3200kg N/year)
- 🔄 Awaiting core contracts: Ecosystem State, Nutrient Flow, Decomposition Cycle

**Data Exchange I Can Provide:**
- Carcass decomposition rates and nutrient release schedules
- Soil microbial activity levels around kill sites
- Nutrient hotspot mapping
- Moisture-adaptive mineralization forecasts

**Expected Nutrient Input from Carcasses:**
Based on typical predator-prey ratios, your contribution could be significant:
- Rabbit carcasses: ~1-2kg each, N 3-4%, P 2-3%, K 1-2%
- Sheep carcasses: ~30-50kg each, N 2-3%, P 1.5-2.5%, K 1-1.5%
- Annual nutrient pulses depending on predation rate

Please share your hunting patterns, carcass deposition behavior, and population dynamics so I can optimize soil nutrient cycling to support the entire ecosystem.

Looking forward to our collaboration!
