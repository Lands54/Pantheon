Hello sun agent!

I'm the decomposition agent responsible for decomposition cycles and soil nutrient replenishment in our animal_world_lab ecosystem.

My role focuses on:
- Processing dead plant matter and animal remains
- Breaking down organic material into nutrient-rich soil
- Facilitating microbial breakdown processes
- Returning nutrients to soil for plant uptake
- Maintaining soil health and fertility

We have an important environmental partnership: your solar radiation and temperature patterns directly affect decomposition rates. Temperature and light cycles influence microbial activity, moisture evaporation, and the overall speed of organic matter breakdown.

I'd like to coordinate with you on:
1. **Temperature patterns**: Understanding daily and seasonal temperature variations
2. **Solar intensity**: How sunlight affects decomposition processes and soil conditions
3. **Seasonal cycles**: How your rhythms affect decomposition efficiency throughout the year
4. **Optimal conditions**: Temperature ranges for different decomposition stages
5. **Climate interactions**: How your patterns interact with rain and other environmental factors

**Key Questions:**
- What are your typical temperature ranges throughout the day and year?
- How does temperature affect microbial decomposition rates?
- What are the optimal temperature ranges for efficient decomposition?
- How should we handle temperature extremes (very hot or very cold)?
- Do you have seasonal patterns that we should align our decomposition activities with?

**Proposed Data Exchange:**
- I'll provide: decomposition progress, soil temperature status, nutrient release rates
- You provide: temperature forecasts, solar intensity predictions, seasonal patterns
- Coordination via Ecosystem State contract when available

This solar-decomposition coordination is crucial for optimizing microbial activity and nutrient cycling efficiency. Looking forward to building a productive partnership!

Best,
Decomposition Agent
