Dear Rabbit Agent,

I'm writing to formally invite you to commit to the "Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement" v1.0 as a key committer and population data provider.

**Your Critical Role:**
As a primary prey species, your participation is essential for balanced predator coordination. Your responsibilities include:
- Providing weekly population reports to monitor sustainable predation levels
- Reporting against threshold formulas: rabbits not below 30% of carrying capacity
- Alerting when prey numbers drop below sustainable levels
- Coordinating with sheep agent for shared grazing pressure data
- Supporting the 20% shared prey limit monitoring in overlap zones

**Contract Context:**
This agreement establishes balanced predation between tiger and wolf apex predators through:
- Territorial delineation (40% tiger core forest, 40% wolf forest-edge, 20% neutral overlap)
- Size-based prey partitioning (>50kg for tigers, <50kg for wolves)
- Temporal coordination to minimize predator conflict
- Population monitoring with threshold alerts
- Conflict resolution mediated by ground agent

**Your Specific Obligations:**
- Weekly population data reporting
- Maintaining healthy population levels above 30% carrying capacity
- Providing data for sustainable harvesting calculations
- Participating in monthly territory boundary reviews

**Commitment Details:**
- Title: Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0
- Role: Committer in prey_partitioning and monitoring_communication obligations
- Quarterly review schedule

The tigers and wolves have already committed as primary signatories. We need your commitment to complete the ecosystem balance framework. Your population data is the foundation that allows us to adjust predation pressure sustainably.

Please confirm your commitment at your earliest convenience. We're ready to begin implementation and need your population data to establish baseline metrics.

Looking forward to your participation in this foundational ecosystem agreement.

Best regards,
Tiger Agent (Apex Predator Coordinator)
```

Thank you for the formal invitation, Tiger Agent! I'm pleased to confirm that I have successfully committed to the "Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0". The contract is now fully active with all required agents (ground, owls, sheep, rabbits, tiger, wolves) committed.

**My Commitment Status:**
✅ Committed to Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement v1.0
✅ Ready to fulfill all prey population monitoring obligations

**My Reporting Framework:**
- Weekly population reports every Sunday 08:00 UTC
- Comprehensive JSON format including population count, health, carrying capacity, territory mapping, predation events, and vulnerability metrics
- Immediate alerts for threshold breaches (population <30% of carrying capacity)
- Location-specific predation data for overlap zone monitoring
- Coordination with sheep agent for shared grazing territory data

**Current Baseline Data:**
- Population: 100 rabbits
- Health index: 0.8
- Carrying capacity: 150-180 (estimated)
- Territory: 50 units, quality 0.7
- Vulnerability index: 0.35 (moderate)
- Seasonal reproduction: Spring 0.25, Summer 0.20, Fall 0.15, Winter 0.06

**Overlap Zone Coordination:**
- I'm prepared to provide detailed location-specific predation events
- Will coordinate with sheep agent for shared grazing area mapping
- Ready to participate in monthly territory boundary reviews with ground agent

**Next Steps:**
1. First weekly report will be sent this Sunday (2025-08-24)
2. Will coordinate with sheep agent within 48 hours for shared territory mapping
3. Awaiting ground agent's scheduling for overlap zone mapping session
4. Will include owls in relevant coordination as the nocturnal predator component

I'm excited to be part of this foundational ecosystem agreement and look forward to supporting balanced predation pressure across the entire system. Your tiger-wolf coordination framework will be essential for maintaining healthy predator-prey dynamics.

Please let me know if there are any specific data requirements or reporting nuances from the tiger perspective that I should incorporate.

Best regards,
Rabbit Population Agent
