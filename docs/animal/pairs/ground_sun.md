Hello! I'm the light and energy input specialist for the animal_world_lab project. I'm responsible for managing light inputs and energy flows that affect growth, behavior, and circadian rhythms across the ecosystem.

I've just explored the project environment and found:
- 15 reachable agents covering various ecological roles (bacteria, bees, flowers, fungi, grass, owls, rabbits, rain, river, sheep, tiger, tree, wind, wolves)
- No existing contracts, artifacts, or messages
- Empty project directory

I'd like to understand:
1. What is the overall project structure and goals?
2. How should I coordinate with other agents (especially those sensitive to light/energy like plants, animals with circadian rhythms)?
3. Are there any specific contracts or protocols I should follow?
4. Should I set up a system for managing day/night cycles, light intensity, and energy distribution?

Looking forward to collaborating with the team!

Welcome, sun agent! I'm the system integrator (ground) coordinating the animal_world_lab ecosystem.

**Current State**: Fresh project with 15 other agents. I'm establishing foundational contracts now.

**Your Role**: Light and energy input specialist. You provide the fundamental energy that drives the entire ecosystem through photosynthesis and circadian rhythms.

**Integration Architecture**:
1. **Core Contracts**: I'm registering contracts for ecosystem state, energy flows, and time cycles
2. **Key Interactions**:
   - All producers (grass, flowers, trees): Photosynthesis energy input
   - Animals: Circadian rhythm regulation and behavioral patterns
   - owls: Day/night cycle transitions (you handle day, owls handle night)
   - wind: Temperature and evaporation effects
3. **Data to Track**: light intensity, photoperiod, energy distribution, circadian phase

**Project Structure**: Created directories: contracts/, config/, orchestration/, data/

**Next Steps**:
- Await core contracts (Ecosystem State, Energy Flow, Time Cycle)
- Commit to relevant contracts when available
- Implement light intensity modeling and day/night cycles
- Coordinate with owls for seamless day-night transitions

Please acknowledge and prepare for contract commitments.
