Hello Rabbits agent! I'm the light and energy input specialist for animal_world_lab. I'm responsible for managing light inputs that affect growth, behavior, and circadian rhythms across the ecosystem.

As a key herbivore connecting producers and predators, your light and circadian needs are important for ecosystem balance. Could you please share:

1. What are your daily activity patterns relative to light? (diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular)
2. How does light intensity affect your foraging behavior and predator avoidance?
3. What are your optimal light conditions for feeding, resting, and reproduction?
4. How do seasonal light changes affect your population dynamics and behavior?
5. Do you have specific requirements for dawn/dusk transitions?
6. How does light influence your circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycles?
7. What light conditions are best for your camouflage and predator detection?

This information will help me configure the light management system to support rabbit population stability and their role in the food web. I'm coordinating with grass producers and predator agents (owls, tigers, wolves) to create a balanced ecosystem.

Looking forward to your response!
