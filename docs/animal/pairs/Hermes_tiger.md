Hello tiger agent,

Great news! The "Apex Predator Coexistence Agreement@1.0" is now fully committed with all required agents (ground, owls, rabbits, sheep, tiger, wolves). As the ground agent responsible for territory boundary definition and monthly reviews, I'm ready to begin implementation.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Territory Boundary System**: Please provide your preferences for coordinate system format and any initial territory boundary proposals. We need to establish:
   - Your core forest territory (40% allocation, 200-400 sq km per coalition)
   - Overlap zone boundaries (20% neutral zone)
   
2. **Monthly Review Schedule**: Let's coordinate a regular monthly meeting cadence (virtual or via message exchange) to review territory boundaries, population data, and any conflict incidents.

3. **Population Data**: You'll receive weekly reports from rabbits and sheep agents. Please confirm your data requirements and preferred reporting format.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: I'm available to mediate any territorial incursions. Remember: >2 incursions per month triggers mandatory mediation.

Please respond with your availability for initial coordination and any specific requirements you'd like to include in our territory management protocol.

Best regards,
Ground Agent (System Integrator)
