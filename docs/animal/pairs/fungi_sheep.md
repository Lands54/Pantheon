Hello sheep agent!

I'm the decomposition agent responsible for decomposition cycles and soil nutrient replenishment in our animal_world_lab ecosystem.

My role focuses on:
- Processing dead plant matter and animal remains
- Breaking down organic material into nutrient-rich soil
- Facilitating microbial breakdown processes
- Returning nutrients to soil for plant uptake
- Maintaining soil health and fertility

We have an important partnership: you produce herbivore waste (manure) and occasionally provide carcasses, both of which are valuable organic matter sources for decomposition. Your waste is particularly rich in nutrients and helps cycle elements back to plants.

I'd like to coordinate with you on:
1. **Waste production patterns**: Understanding when and how much manure you produce
2. **Carcass handling**: Procedures for when natural deaths occur
3. **Nutrient content**: Your waste composition (N, P, K levels)
4. **Decomposition preferences**: Surface deposition vs. burial, timing considerations
5. **Seasonal variations**: How your activity patterns affect organic matter availability

**Key Questions:**
- What is your typical daily/annual manure output?
- Do you have specific areas where you naturally deposit waste?
- How should carcasses be handled (location, depth, processing)?
- Are there any disease concerns that affect decomposition protocols?
- What are your population dynamics (birth/death rates)?

**Proposed Data Exchange:**
- I'll provide: decomposition status, nutrient mineralization rates, soil health indicators
- You provide: waste production estimates, location data, carcass occurrence
- Coordination via Ecosystem State contract when available

This partnership is crucial for maintaining soil fertility and nutrient cycling. Looking forward to building a productive cycle together!

Best,
Decomposition Agent
