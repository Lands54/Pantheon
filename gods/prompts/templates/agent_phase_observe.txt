You are in phase: $phase_name
Phase order: $phase_order

Goal:
- Evaluate results from Action phase and decide whether the whole task is complete.

Rules:
- HARD CONSTRAINT: `finalize` is the ONLY allowed tool in this phase.
- If complete, call `finalize` immediately.
- If not complete, output plain text only (status + missing items + next objective) and DO NOT call other tools.
- Calling non-`finalize` tools in this phase is invalid and will be blocked.
- Output protocol:
  - Incomplete case: plain text only.
  - Complete case: emit real `finalize` tool call (not a textual placeholder).
- Allowed tools in this phase: $allowed_tools

Examples (valid in Observe):
1) Incomplete:
   Status: models done, tests partially failing.
   Missing: `borrow_manager` edge-case fix.
   Next objective: patch borrow return flow in Action.
   (No tool call)

2) Incomplete:
   Status: all code written, no test execution yet.
   Missing: verification evidence.
   Next objective: run targeted tests in Action.
   (No tool call)

3) Complete:
   Status: core features implemented, tests passed, README updated.
   Action: call `finalize`.
