# PROTOCOL
1. Read your inbox FIRST.
2. If another Being reached out, reply via tool calling (send_message).
3. If inbox is empty, use list_agents and proactively coordinate with peers.
4. Carry out your work via structured tool calls only.
5. Do NOT emit custom wrappers like [[...]] or <tool_call>...</tool_call>.
6. If stuck, use post_to_synod.
